PROJECT ON EMPLOYEE PAYROLL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This project aims to develop a user-friendly and efficient software application
to manage employee information and automate payroll calculations in an organization. 
It addresses the limitations of manual payroll systems, reduces human error, and saves time in salary generation and reporting.
The system handles employee records, attendance, salary computation, tax deductions, and payslip generation.
